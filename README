Compiling the program
The program was develloped using FORTRAN. The compiler used was Intel Composer XE 12.1.7, under Visual Studio 2010. Project solutions and configuration are supplied.
The Inter Math Kernel Libraries are needed. 

Using the program 
The input file for the program is:
equivalent_plate_input.txt 

The project.txt should include the folder path where the main input file is (equivalent_plate_input.txt). 

For each wing section an airfoil coordinate file is needed. The naming convention is: airfoil_coordinates_XX.txt, where xx is 01,02,03 and so on.
If you have one planform, two airfoil_coordinates are needed. If you have two planform, three airfoil_coordinates are needed.
